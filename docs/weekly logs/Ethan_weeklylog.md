#### Did not save on the website so the TA cannot see the result.

- This week, I worked on making the UML diagram and also tried to host the project on AWS.
  - So far I have tried EC2, which is still in progress figuring out problems, Elastic Beanstalk, which doesn't like my login credentials, and Lambda, which I can't figure out how to install the dependencies without breaking the other stuff.
- The guides I tried includes the following:
  - [AWS Lambda](https://dev.to/vaddimart/deploy-django-app-on-aws-lambda-using-serverless-part-1-1i90)
  - [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html)
  - [AWS EC2](https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-deploy-a-django-project-on-an-amazon-ec2-instance-with-apache-875f925d0a9a)
